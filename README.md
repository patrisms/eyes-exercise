# Eyes Exercise

MIT xPRO Week 8: Styles and Bootstrap

# Description

This animated project was created primarily in JavaScript as part of my coursework for the MIT xPRO Full Stack Web Development program. It is a project that features two eyes where the eyeballs move along with the mouse cursor.

# Installation/Usage
There are no specific installation steps. Just download the files, and have a blast! Feel free to use and edit as you see fit!

# Roadmap
As I learn how to get more creative with JavaScript, I hope to expand on this project by including more body parts such as an interative nose and mouth.
